I am woman, I am fearless
I am sexy, I'm divine
I'm unbeatable, I'm creative
Honey, you can get in line
I am feminine, I am masculine
I am anything I want
I can teach you, I can love you
If you got it goin' on

If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it
If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it goin' on
Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it
If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it goin' on
Got it on goin' on, yeah
(Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it goin' on)
(Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it goin' on)
