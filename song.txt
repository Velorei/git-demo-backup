I am woman, I am fearless
I am sexy, I'm divine
I'm unbeatable, I'm creative
Honey, you can get in line
I am feminine, I am masculine
I am anything I want
I can teach you, I can love you
If you got it goin' on

If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it
If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it goin' on
Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it
If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it goin' on
Got it on goin' on, yeah
(Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it goin' on)
(Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it goin' on)

I am classy, I am modern, I live by my own design
I'm cherry, I'm lemon, I'm the sweetest key lime pie
I'm electric, I'm bass, I'm the beat of my own drum
I could make your goosebumps raise with the tracing of my thumb

Only love can get inside me
I move in my own timing
Voice of the future, speak to me kindly
I feel what I want and somehow it find me
Somehow it find me
Somehow it find me
Yeah, hey, hey

If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it
If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it goin' on
Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it
If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it goin' on
Got it goin' on, yeah
(Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it goin' on)
(Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it goin' on, yeah, yeah)
