I am woman, I am fearless
I am sexy, I'm divine
I'm unbeatable, I'm creative
Honey, you can get in line
I am feminine, I am masculine
I am anything I want
I can teach you, I can love you
If you got it goin' on

Hear no evil, speak no evil
I am not the one to cross
They can talk that shit about you
Long as you know that it's false
I am earthly, I am heaven
I am what I like to be
When I ask for what I want
Somehow it find me
Somehow it find me
(Hey, hey)

If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it
If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it goin' on
Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it
If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it goin' on
Got it on goin' on, yeah
(Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it goin' on)
(Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it goin' on)
